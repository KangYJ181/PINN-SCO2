1. This part is to determine the number of hidden layers and the range of hidden neuron sizes for networks base on experimental data D1 and D2.

2. The number of RNN layers is set to 2, according to the previous research and data similarity.

3. Global parameters (most of them are based on our previous research):

    (1) k- fold number: 10

    (2) epoch: 880

    (3) batch size: 32

    (4) learning rate: 8e-4

    (5) regularity coefficient L2 = 4e-6

4. The range of hidden layers and hidden neuron sizes (assume that each layer has the same number of neurons)

    (1) number of hidden layers = 1, 2, 3, 4

    (2) number of hidden neurons = 7, 8, ..., 20

5. The errors under different parameters are calculated.
